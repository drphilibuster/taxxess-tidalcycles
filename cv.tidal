-- figuring out cv

--  SuperDirt Voltage
-- Pitch, with scale quantisation
-- change notes per octave on each cycle
d1 $ pitch "0 10 8 1" # scale "<12 31 8>" # x 0

--  pitch allows a pattern of note values. scale sets the amount of notes per octave. The pitch and scale values will be converted to 1v/octave. Both pitch and scale can be sequenced for some microtonal madness...

--  glide accepts a strengh (in semitones, relative to scale), a rate (in step length).

-- glide to pitch
d1 $ pitch "0 10 8 1" # scale "<12 31 8>" # x 0 # glide 12 0.5

--  Gate
-- sequence gate inputs
d2 $ gate "0 1 0 0 1 1 1" # x 1

--  gate will take a 0/1 pattern and return +5v signals for the 1 values. Use -1 if you need a -5v.

--  Voltage automation
-- create stepped automation
d3 $ volt "1 0.2 0.5 -0.2" # x 2

--  volt will allow you to sequence voltages however you like.

--  AR (Attack + Release)
-- create ar
d4 $ trig "1 ~ 1 1" # ar 0 0.5 # x 3

 -- patternise adsr
d5 $ trig "1 ~ 1 1" # ar (range 0.1 1 sine) "<0 0.4>" # x 4

--  trig will create a trigger sequence, ar will generate a new envelope for each trigger. Both of these can be sequenced.

--  In the second example, the attack time would grow for each triggered envelope over course of the cycle.

--  Clock
-- clock cv output
d6 $ clock # x 5

--  clock will output a clock cv, which matches the bpm of your tidal project. You can slow / fast this as well.
